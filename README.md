Warehouse Management - Shoe Demand Analysis
📝 Objective
The goal of this analysis is to explore shoe demand trends in warehouse sales data. We focus on understanding how demand varies with shoe sizes and across different months, to inform better stocking and inventory strategies.

🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Cleaned and explored data containing shoe sales information including sizes, sale price, date, and gender.

Analyzed demand trends by month and shoe size (US).

Identified patterns in seasonal variation and most in-demand sizes.

📊 Key Findings
